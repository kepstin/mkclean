Description: tool to clean and optimize Matroska and WebM files
 mkclean is a command line tool to clean and optimize Matroska (.mkv / .mka /
 .mks / .mk3d) and WebM (.webm / .weba) files that have already been muxed. It
 reorders the elements with the Cues at the front, so your Matroska files are
 ready to be streamed efficiently over the web. It also removes elements not
 found in the Matroska specs and the extra Meta Seek list of Clusters that some
 program add to their file. It can also optionally remux the Cluster blocks to
 start each boundary with a keyframe and the matching audio/subtitle blocks for
 that keyframe.
